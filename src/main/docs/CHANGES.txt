CHANGES for LIRE
================

2012-12-20
==========
  - Release 0.9.3

2012-12-20
==========
  - Added OpponentHistogram to ImageSearcherFactory and DocumentBuilderFactory.
  - Updated LireDemo to include Joint Histogram and Opponent Histogram.
  - Added JointOpponentHistogram, fooled around with fuzzy opponent histogram ... didn't work out well.

2012-12-12
==========
  - changed Histogram abstract class member to double[] ... it's much faster
    on 64 bit systems running Java 1.7.
  - Changed  BufferedImage convertImageToGrey(...) to faster version.
  - Change JointHistogram.java to use this method.
  - Cleaned up SimpleColorHistogram a bit.
  - Cleaned up AutoColorCorrelogram a bit.
  - Added OpponentHistogram with JSD as a distance function.
  - Checked for a way to re-implement Metric Spaces approach with Lucene:
    Currently there is no way as the TermPositions object has gone missing.
    Other ideas would be to integrate a new similarity based on footrule
    distance. Or: put it in a simple byte[] based text file ?!?

2012-12-12
==========
